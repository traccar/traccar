# This test data assumes device "123456789012345" exists.
#
#     INSERT INTO device ( name, uniqueid )
#         VALUES ( 'Test Device 1', 123456789012345 );
#
# Note: Not all shells support "echo -e" (e.g., dash, the default on Ubuntu).
#       This will cause an unknown device error for "-e".  bash works.
